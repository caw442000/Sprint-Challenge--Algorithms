#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n): as the size of the input grows the runtime will grow at the same rate 


b) O(n log n): even though it is nested loops the while loop is moving twice as fast due to the multiplier.  this makes that inner loop a log n


c) O(n): assuming bunnies is the n value with this being a recursive call it will increase at the same rate as the input grows
